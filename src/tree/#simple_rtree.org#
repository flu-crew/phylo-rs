So the simple_rtree "trait" does the following
It gives a basic implementation for all possible rooted trees

For a tree what is required
- Node :: Implements hash  
- Edge :: 


do it simpler

SimpleTree
-add_node(&self) -> Node;
-remove_node(&self) ->

What should a tree do at it's most basis step
- add_node(&self)-> Node;
- set_child
